## Hi everyone 👋

My name is Michael.

Frontend developer (React, TypeScript), specializing in SPA and admin interfaces for corporate CMS.
I develop a library of UI components (React, styled-components, Storybook) and participate in the development of an admin panel with SSR.
I create reusable solutions to speed up development and maintainability of interfaces, and I work with REST API integrations.
I have experience refactoring legacy projects and gradually modernizing them without interrupting development.
